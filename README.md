Obstacle Avoidance System for Robots
====================================

An obstacle avoidance system is a critical part of robotic navigation, where a robot must detect obstacles in its path and take appropriate action to avoid collisions. This system uses sensors, such as cameras or LiDAR, to perceive the environment and uses algorithms to make decisions about how to navigate safely. In this project, we will implement a simple obstacle avoidance system for a robot using a reactive control approach. The robot will detect obstacles in its environment and change its trajectory to avoid them.

Environment and Tools
---------------------
    
*   **Python Libraries**:
    
    *   numpy: For numerical operations.
        
    *   matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.
        
    *   scikit-fuzzy: For implementing the fuzzy logic controller.
        

Files in this Project
---------------------

*   code.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code to connect to the CoppeliaSim simulator, define the fuzzy logic controller, and run the obstacle avoidance simulation.
